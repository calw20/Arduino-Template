TL;DR: The legal babble is below (it's what applies), this is a quick note to you!
Do what you want with this project. I made it mostly to further my knowledge in
its respective felids, so it is most likely going to be a jumbled, barely
functional, glob of what I hope can be called code. Hence I can't promise it
wont break, cry, give you up or create a rift in time and space. Sorry.
So if you do end up using this, please let me know as I would love to see how its
used. Now if for some reason you feel like this has helped you in some useful way
and you manage to spot me out in the world, feel free to buy me a drink (coffee or
beer is always nice) but I highly doubt this will have been useful enough for that.
Enjoy and good luck!
